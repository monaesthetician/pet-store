    <p>Ever stared at your pup and wondered what he’s thinking?
    What he’d say if he could speak?
    Would he tell you that he’s happy? That he has tummy aches? Allergies?
    Ever wondered what his droopy eyes and pale tongue mean?
    
    Well, at Side by Side we’ve developed a tool that helps us understand what’s going on with your dog and translates that for you!
    Through time tested principles of Eastern Food Therapy [EFT], we’re able to assess what your pup is communicating because your pet’s internal imbalances are manifested externally – you just need the proper training in EFT to do the translating.
    
    EFT principles have been time tested and they’re based on food energetics. In Western theory, we think of food as fuel. EFT goes one step further and classifies all foods based on whether it has warming, cooling or neutral energy property. Consider as humans the effects of foods such as pumpkin. Pumpkin is a comfort food that makes you feel warm and full, hence it’s classified as a warming food. Or, let’s consider celery which has a soothing effect on your system. Celery is considered a cooling food.</p>
